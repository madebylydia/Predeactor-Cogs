# Predeactor-Cogs

This repo holds my old cogs for [Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators) v3.
It contains the story of how I've grown up in Python and how I got into programming in the first place.

However, as I interact less with the community, I had decided to remove the availability of this repo, mostly because I wanted to focus on other stuff.
I do not plan to make my come back, not yet at least. I am just posting this repo as some sort of *"Farewell"* of what I used to make.

I am very happy with how I've progressed, and I regret my decision to delete my cog's repository.
Somehow, I lost a part of my life that probably matters the most today.

Big thanks to everyone who used my cogs, who contributed to the code, and made me progress to what I am today.

# Hey! You left Red?

That is the message I sent in the cog creator's channel to announce I will stop my cogs.
I... I had to go. I had to stop this repo, I had enough and I wanted to go somewhere else, somewhere where I was pleased again...
I don't want to talk much. These are very short word for last words. But I seriously don't care...
I'll archive the repo now... see ya.
