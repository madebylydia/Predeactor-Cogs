    "Captain speaking...\nWell. https://i.imgur.com/Xa0IWXX.png\n\nYeah, I'm leaving Red's verified repos. I wanted that since some times... That's not even a year since I'm a cog creator and I already am... bored of it...\nThis message isn't the story of my life btw, I'm just here to tell you that Captcha will still be supported by Kreusada, another cog creator."
    "\nSo if you're using captcha, delete this cog, and use Kreusada's repository to install captcha cog.\n"
    "I feel kinda free now, of course, also sad. it's one of the first project to launch me in the stars. That's... that's hard, of course, but I somewhat had to.\n\n"
    "I don't know how confusing this message will be for you, but in short (TLDR), I stop supporting my cogs, my repo, and just give Kreusada's the right to continue Captcha..."
    "\n\nI've been a bad dev too lol. yeah, belive me I broke many shit in my cogs, not just 'Traceback in command AAAAAAAAA' yeah... so... Kreusada will be good for fixing my mistakes, I guess.\n\n"
    "**I just have a last word for you by the way!**\nIf you received this message, that's because you haven't yet updated the cog, or just installed the cog from my repo. "
    "And I'm grateful. Thank you user. Thank you for being an user of one of my cog. It's just good to know that you are reading this, that you have been supporting me by just using this cog. "
    "Thank you for reading this. Thank you for listening to me and thank you for being an user of Red. I would never have been here today if you had never installed this bot. Thank you.\n\n"
    "This was your captain's last word. See you later.\n\nLink to Kreusada's repo: https://github.com/Kreusada/Kreusada-Cogs"

        "This cog is the super, evolved version of my old cog, Captcher, which is now officially "
        "deprecated for this cog, and oh god, this is really a big step for me!\n\n"
        "What can I say now? YeahRight! This message. You don't need to worry about them, they are "
        "just my patchnotes for this cog! I hope you don't mind me for adding them, I may use them "
        "sometime, that's cool to keep peoples updated. You'll receive a message each time the "
        "patchnotes got updated.\n\n"
        "So, what happened during the rewrite/migration? In case you was an user of Captcher, I "
        "decided to drop your data and don't reuse them, meaning that all guilds will have to "
        "reconfigure this new cog to use captcha again.\n\n"
        "Oh yeah, super thing I'm proud of, there's now 3 types of Captcha, image, wheezy and plain."
        "They're super cool, plain is using plain text, and have a little security to avoid copy and "
        "paste. There's also wheezy, an easier to read captcha, with less drawing. This new and "
        "amazing functionallity goes back to calebj, creator of the Captcha cog for Red V2, which "
        "had the same thing, I got inspired of it and copied some code. Thank you!\n\n"
        "AH yes, cog's stability, it is now WAY more stable than before, and way more efficient and "
        "easier to maintain. \N{UPSIDE-DOWN FACE}\n\n"
