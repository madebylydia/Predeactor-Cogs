# How to contribute

### Bug report

If you encounter a problem during the installation of a cog and/or during its use, here is a list to follow to try to solve it without having to open an issue or to contact me:
- Try to update the repository: `[p]repo update`.
- Did you manually change the code? If yes, use the code available on the repo.
- Are you missing a module? If so, use the command `[p]pipinstall`.

If you still can't solve your problem, open an issue.

### Suggestions

If your suggestion is related to a cog:
- Open an issue and select `Feature request`
- Explain your feature.

If you want to request a suggestion for something else, feel free to contact me, you can join my [support server](https://discord.gg/zg6ydua) or contact me on Discord at `Capt. Pred#0495` (Try to avoid random friend request).

### Feature Request

Thank you for helping us to improve the repository, and thanks for your suggestions, our workings will be more in tune with the community and allow the improvement of them.
- Open an issue and select `Feature Request`.
- Make your magic.

### Pull requests

If you plan to open a pull request, please check the following points:
- Your code must be adapted with [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) and must respect the line length, which is set to 99 (`black -l 99`).
- Your code must be tested beforehand and must work.
- Check your code a second time to remove the useless (Unused variable, checks, etc...).
- Your code should be as similar as possible to the cog's code.
- Your code must agree to pre-commit rules. Run `pre-commit` in your terminal to apply automatic fix.
